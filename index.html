    <p class="description">
        Hi! John Mark Luslos is my name, and I am twenty years old. I presently attend Marinduque State College to study information technology, and I reside in Maligaya, Boac, Marinduque. My goal is to make a positive impact on society and the game industry in the future through my enthusiasm for online and game creation. When I'm not working, I like to watch anime, play the guitar, and play video games on my phone or home console. My creativity and curiosity propel me, and I firmly think that lifelong learning and teamwork can provide immersive experiences that benefit society as well as the game industry.
